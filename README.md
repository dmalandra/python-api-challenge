# Python API Weather / Vacation Challenge

Within the WeatherPy notebook, weather data was generated via the citipy library and the OpenWeatherMap API for 500 cities across the world.  Various scatter plots were created to scrutinize the relationships between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed.  Linear regression modeling was analyzed for similar relationships by hemisphere.

In the VacationPy notebook, weather data was utilized from the WeatherPy notebook, as well as the geoViews library and the GeoApify API to create map visuals.  Cities were narrowed by ideal weather conditions, then hotels were mapped within a 10,000m radius of the ideal weather cities.
